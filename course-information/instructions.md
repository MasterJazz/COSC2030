# Instructions  

Write a program that creates a map containing course numbers and the room numbers of the rooms where the courses meet. The map should have the following key-value pairs:

| Course Number (Key) | Room Number (Value) |
| ------------------- | ------------------- |
| CS101 | 3004 |
| CS102 | 4501 |
| CS103 | 6755 |
| NT110 | 1244 |
| CM240 | 1411 |

The program should also create a map containing course numbers and the names of the instructors that teach each course. The map should have the following key-value pairs:

| Course Number (Key) | Instructor (Value) |
| ------------------- | ------------------ |
| CS101 | Haynes |
| CS102 | Alvarado |
| CS103 | Rich |
| NT110 | Burke |
| CM240 | Lee |

The program should also create a map containing course numbers and the meeting times of each course. The map should have the following key-value pairs:

| Course Number (Key) | Meeting Time (Value) |
| ------------------- | -------------------- |
| CS101 | 8:00 a.m. |
| CS102 | 9:00 a.m. |
| CS103 | 10:00 a.m. |
| NT110 | 11:00 a.m. |
| CM240 | 1:00 p.m. |

The program should let the user enter a course number, then it should display the course's room number, instructor, and meeting time.
