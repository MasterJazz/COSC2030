# Instructions  

This assignment assumes you have completed the `Employee` and `ProductionWorker` Classes Programming Project. Modify the `Employee` and `ProductionWorker ` classes so they throw exceptions when the following errors occur:

• The `Employee` class should throw an exception named `InvalidEmployeeNumber` when it receives an employee number that is less than 0 or greater than 9999.
• The `ProductionWorker` class should throw an exception named `InvalidShift` when it receives an invalid shift.
• The `ProductionWorker` class should throw an exception named `InvalidPayRate` when it receives a negative number for the hourly pay rate.

Write a driver program that demonstrates how each of these exception conditions`works.
