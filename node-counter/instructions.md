# Instructions  

Write your own version of a class template that will create a binary tree that can hold values of any data type. You might want to demonstrate the class with a dirver program to ensure that it works correctly.

Then, write a member function for the template you designed that counts and returns the number of nodes in the tree. Demonstrate the function in a driver program.
