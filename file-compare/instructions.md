# Instructions  

Write a program that opens two text files and reads their contents into two separate queues. The program should then determine whether the files are identical by comparing the characters in the queues. When two nonidentical characters are encountered, the program should display a message indicating that the files are not the same. If both queues contain the same set of characters, a message should be displayed indicating that the files are identical.
