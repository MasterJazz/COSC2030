# Instructions  

Design a class called `NumDays`. The class’s purpose is to store a value that represents a number of work hours and convert it to a number of days. For example, 8 hours would be converted to 1 day, 12 hours would be converted to 1.5 days, and 18 hours would be converted to 2.25 days. The class should have a constructor that accepts a number of hours, as well as member functions for storing and retrieving the hours and days. The class should also have the following overloaded operators:

___Addition operator (+).___ When two `NumDays` objects are added together, the overloaded + operator should return the sum of the two objects’ hours members.
___Subtraction operator (-).___ When one `NumDays` object is subtracted from another, the overloaded - operator should return the difference of the two objects’ hours members.
___Prefix and postfix increment operators (++).___ These operators should increment the number of hours stored in the object. When incremented, the number of days should be automatically recalculated.
___Prefix and postfix decrement operators (--).___ These operators should decrement the number of hours stored in the object. When decremented, the number of days should be automatically recalculated.
